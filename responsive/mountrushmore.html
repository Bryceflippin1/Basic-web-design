            <h2 class="headingstyle">History of <a href="https://www.nps.gov/moru/index.htm">Mount Rushmore</a></h2>
            <p>Mount Rushmore National Memorial, located in the Black Hills of South Dakota,
                 is one of the most iconic landmarks in the United States, symbolizing the 
                 nation's history, heritage, and democracy. The idea for the monument was 
                 conceived by South Dakota historian Doane Robinson in the 1920s as a way
                  to promote tourism in the state. Initially, Robinson envisioned sculptures 
                  of notable Western figures, but the project took a different turn when renowned 
                  sculptor Gutzon Borglum was brought in to design it. Borglum's vision focused on 
                  the faces of four U.S. presidents: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George Washington</a>,
                   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt"> Theodore Roosevelt</a>
                   , and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>,
                   representing the birth, expansion, development, 
                  and preservation of the country. Construction began in 1927, with the carving
                   process being both monumental and painstaking. Borglum faced numerous challenges, 
                   including harsh weather, technical difficulties, and financial constraints. The
                    project was funded by both federal and private sources, and over 400 workers, 
                    many of whom were miners and stone carvers, contributed to its completion.
                     Tragically, Borglum passed away in 1941 before the monument's full vision 
                     could be realized, and his son Lincoln Borglum oversaw its completion. The 
                     heads of the presidents, each about 60 feet tall, are carved into granite, 
                     with intricate details that capture the likenesses of these figures in American
                      history. The memorial was finished in October 1941, and despite being a work 
                      of unfinished ambition—Borglum had hoped to carve the presidents from head 
                      to waist—the monument remains a symbol of American ideals and resilience. 
                      Over the decades, Mount Rushmore has become a significant cultural and historical 
                      symbol, attracting millions of visitors each year who come to admire the artistry 
                      and reflect on the country’s rich and complex history.</p>
