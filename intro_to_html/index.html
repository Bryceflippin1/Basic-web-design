        <p>At a population of just under 6,000 people, the seed of Butte County is a small town called Belle Fourche. 
            It's probably a town you've never heard of, and you also might be thinking why write about a random small 
            town. Well, it's the geographic center of the United States. It wasn't always the center though. Before we 
            acquired Alaska and Hawaii the center of the nation was Lebanon, Kansas. The town now tracks tourism for its 
            center of the nation monument and along with it the Tri-State Museum where you can stand in three states at once.</p>

            <h2>Why it's important to Me</h2>
<hr>
            <p>It all started one random day. Me and some friends were managing a booth at an art show, and this guy came
                 over to us and asked us if we had ever been to South Dakoata. I told him I had planned it once and that me 
                 and some friends were planning on going to the world's largest potluck at Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He said 
                 he'd been there and proceeded to tell us about a huge rodeo that does fireworks on July 4th every year and 
                 about how cool he thought <a href="https://www.nps.gov/moru/index.htm">Mount Rushmor</a>e was. Hours go by, he reapproaches with his wife, and she also says 
                 she is from South Dakota. She asked us what we thought the center of the nation was. My friend guessed
                  Kanas, and she told us it was Belle Fourche. Now it's just been an inside joke between me and my friends.</p>
