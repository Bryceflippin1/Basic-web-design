            <h1>Number 3: Bob Dylan</h1>
            <p>"I ranked Bob Dylan at number 3 because, while he may not have had the same commercial
                 dominance as The Beatles or The Rolling Stones, his impact on music, culture, and 
                 songwriting was unparalleled in the '60s. Dylan revolutionized folk and rock with deep, 
                 poetic lyrics that tackled politics, war, and social change, influencing an entire generation. 
                 Songs like Blowin’ in the Wind and The Times They Are a-Changin’ became anthems of the 
                 civil rights and anti-war movements, proving that music could be more than entertainment—it
                  could be a powerful force for change. When he famously "went electric" in 1965, with Like a
                   Rolling Stone, he reshaped rock music forever, paving the way for countless artists to 
                   experiment with storytelling and sound. Dylan's influence stretched far beyond his own 
                   performances—his songwriting shaped the work of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jimi 
                   Hendrix, and many others. While he wasn’t a pop superstar in the traditional sense, his
                    artistic influence and cultural impact made him one of the most important figures of 
                    the decade, securing his spot at number 3." - ChatGPT
