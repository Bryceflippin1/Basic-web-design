            <h1>Number 1: The Beatles</h1>
            <p>"I put The Beatles at number 1 because they are arguably the most transformative 
                and influential band in the history of music. Their musical innovation, cultural 
                impact, and lasting legacy are unparalleled. The Beatles not only revolutionized 
                rock and pop music with albums like Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and Revolver,
                 but they also pushed the boundaries of what an album could be, elevating it to an 
                 artistic statement. Their songwriting, led by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, is 
                 among the most beloved and groundbreaking in music history, producing timeless 
                 classics such as Hey Jude, Let It Be, and Yesterday. The Beatles shaped popular 
                 culture in the 1960s, becoming symbols of the era’s social and political shifts.
                  Beyond their musical achievements, they influenced fashion, language, and philosophy,
                   embodying the spirit of the 1960s like no other band. Their global popularity, 
                   commercial success, and innovative approach to both music and business make them 
                   undoubtedly number 1." - ChatGPT</p>

<h2>Tragic Deaths of Beatle's Members</h2>
<h3>John Lennon </h3>
<p>John Lennon’s death on December 8, 1980, shocked the world. He was gunned down outside his New York 
    City apartment at the Dakota by Mark David Chapman, a man who had been obsessed with Lennon. Lennon 
    had just returned from a recording session with his wife, Yoko Ono, when Chapman approached him and 
    asked for his autograph earlier in the day. That evening, Lennon was returning home when Chapman approached 
    him again and fired five shots, four of which struck him in the back and shoulder. Lennon was rushed to the 
    hospital but was declared dead on arrival at the age of 40.

    His death marked the end of an era, as Lennon had just come back to the music scene after years of personal 
    reflection and family life. He was mourned by millions around the world, and his untimely passing left a 
    profound impact on music, activism, and culture. Lennon’s legacy as a voice for peace, his revolutionary 
    music, and his role in shaping modern rock music lives on, with songs like Imagine continuing to inspire
     and provoke.</p>
     <h3>George Harrison</h3>
     <p>George Harrison passed away on November 29, 2001, at the age of 58 after a long battle with cancer. 
        He had been fighting throat cancer for several years and was later diagnosed with brain cancer. Harrison 
        spent his final days in Los Angeles, surrounded by his family and friends, including his wife, Olivia Harrison, 
        and son, Dhani Harrison.

        Known for his introspective nature and spiritual quest, George’s death marked the end of the life of one of 
        music’s most beloved and influential figures. He was not only a member of The Beatles but also a pioneering 
        solo artist and humanitarian. His music, like My Sweet Lord and While My Guitar Gently Weeps, continues to resonate
         with fans. Beyond his music, George was deeply involved in charity work, particularly through the Concert for 
         Bangladesh in 1971, one of the first large-scale benefit concerts in history.
        
        Harrison’s death left an irreplaceable void in the music world, but his legacy as a spiritual seeker and a gifted
         musician endures through his solo work, his contributions to The Beatles, and his profound influence on subsequent
          generations of artists.
