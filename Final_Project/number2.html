            <h1>Number 2: The Rolling Stones</h1>
            <p>"I ranked The Rolling Stones at number 2 because, while The Beatles 
                defined the '60s in terms of cultural impact and innovation, the Stones
                 embodied the raw, rebellious spirit of rock and roll and became one of 
                 the most enduring bands in history. With their blues-inspired sound, 
                 swaggering attitude, and electrifying stage presence, they provided a 
                 grittier alternative to The Beatles' polished image. Hits like (I Can’t 
                 Get No) Satisfaction, Paint It Black, and Jumpin’ Jack Flash became defining 
                 songs of the decade, pushing the boundaries of rock music. Unlike many bands 
                 of their era, the Stones kept evolving, setting the stage for the harder 
                 rock and punk movements of the '70s. They also embraced controversy, from 
                 their bad-boy personas to their run-ins with the law, reinforcing the idea
                  that rock was about freedom, rebellion, and attitude. While The Beatles may 
                  have revolutionized the music industry first, The Rolling Stones made sure
                   rock and roll stayed dangerous and exciting, which is why they earn the number
                    2 spot." - ChatGPT

            <h2>Death of Brian Jones</h2>
            <p>Brian Jones tragically died on July 3, 1969, at just 27 years old. He was found drowned in the 
                swimming pool of his home in Sussex, England. While the official cause of death was ruled as 
                "death by misadventure," many speculate that drug and alcohol abuse, along with underlying 
                tensions in his personal life, contributed to his passing. His death came just weeks after he
                 was dismissed from The Rolling Stones due to his declining health and erratic behavior.

                Jones is one of the earliest members of the infamous "27 Club," a term used to describe famous
                 musicians who died at the age of 27, often due to substance abuse or tragic circumstances. Other 
                 legendary artists in this group include Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, 
                 and Amy Winehouse. The eerie pattern of young, immensely talented musicians dying at 27 has 
                 fueled myths and speculation, cementing the 27 Club as one of music’s most haunting legends.
